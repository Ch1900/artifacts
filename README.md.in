### EXAMPLES

#### Example: logs and coverage

In this case, the key and secret are passed as command line flags and
the `log/` and `coverage/` directories are passed as positional path
arguments:

``` bash
artifacts upload \
  -k AKIT339AFIY655O3Q9DZ \
  -s 48TmqyraUyJ7Efpegi6Lfd10yUskAMB0G2TtRCX1 \
  log/ coverage/
```

The same operation using environmental variables would look like this:

``` bash
export ARTIFACTS_KEY="AKIT339AFIY655O3Q9DZ"
export ARTIFACTS_SECRET="48TmqyraUyJ7Efpegi6Lfd10yUskAMB0G2TtRCX1"
export ARTIFACTS_PATHS="log/;coverage/"

artifacts upload
```

#### Example: untracked files

In order to upload all of the untracked files (according to git), one
might do this:

``` bash
artifacts upload \
  -k AKIT339AFIY655O3Q9DZ \
  -s 48TmqyraUyJ7Efpegi6Lfd10yUskAMB0G2TtRCX1 \
  $(git ls-files -o)
```

The same operation using environmental variables would look like this:

``` bash
export ARTIFACTS_KEY="AKIT339AFIY655O3Q9DZ"
export ARTIFACTS_SECRET="48TmqyraUyJ7Efpegi6Lfd10yUskAMB0G2TtRCX1"
export ARTIFACTS_PATHS="$(git ls-files -o | tr "\n" ";")"

artifacts upload
```
