NAME:
   upload - upload some artifacts!

USAGE:
   command upload [command options] [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   
Upload a set of local paths to an artifact repository.  The paths may be
provided as either positional command-line arguments or as the $ARTIFACTS_PATHS
environmental variable, which should be :-delimited.

Paths may be either files or directories.  Any path provided will be walked for
all child entries.  Each entry will have its mime type detected based first on
the file extension, then by sniffing up to the first 512 bytes via the net/http
function "DetectContentType".
